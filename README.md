# Sudoku-evaluating-program

This project was developed as part of a two-part article that appeared in c't and on heise+. The basic idea is to evaluate Sudokus based on the used Strategies.

There are two files:

- `evaluate_sudoku.py` contains the whole Project. Implemented are naked Single, hidden Single, naked Pair, hidden Pair, pointing Pair and X-Wing.
- `evaluate_sudoku_small.py` is a smaller version that contains just naked Single and hidden Single, that are the Topic from the first Article.

## Usage

To evaluate a Sudoku you can change the `board`-variable inside the Program oder use `board-import` to convert a string like 040300000000000100007000546000702419080400020000009000000030060500006081030500000 to a 2D-array. The example Sudoku looks like that:

The programme always tries the easiest strategy before jumping to the next most difficult one. When evaluating, it outputs a log of the solution like this one, for example:
