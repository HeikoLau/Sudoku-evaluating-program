# Sudoku Evaluator

This project was developed as part of a two part article that appeared in [c't magazine](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2023/10/2305515285555975873) and on [heise+](https://heise.de/-8645547). The basic idea is to evaluate Sudokus based on the strategies needed to solve.

There are two files:

- `evaluate_sudoku.py` contains the whole project. Implemented are the strategies Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pair and X-Wing.
- `evaluate_sudoku_small.py` is a smaller version that contains just naked Single and Hidden Single, that are the topic of the first article.

## Usage

To evaluate a Sudoku you can change the variable `board` inside the program oder use `board-import` to convert a string like `040300000000000100007000546000702419080400020000009000000030060500006081030500000` to a 2D array. The example Sudoku looks like that:

The program always tries the easiest strategy before jumping to the one with the next higher difficulty. When evaluating, it outputs a log of the solution like the following for the example Sudoku:
